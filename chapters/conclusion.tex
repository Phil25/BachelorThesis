\section{Further extensibility}

Current state of the program leaves a fair amount of room for potential extensibility.
There are features not yet present which could be very valuable to some users making them worth consideration.
A few of them stem from the specific nature of running a SourceMod server and help in generic set-ups found in practice.

\subsection{Remote file transfer}

An important factor but in some cases also one of the biggest cons of SMAM is that it is a terminal application.
Managing SourceMod plugins is done per game server basis, not the host machine.
This means that in the end a game server is only an application with a file repository around it, which is what is provided by various services out there.
Those services charge users per game server, not the machine, and provide access to the files via popular protocols like FTP\@.
End users do not have access to installing software, rendering SMAM ultimately irrelevant.

However, a straightforward solution for this issue may be implementable.
When specifying the destination of a command, i.e., the server file repository, a network protocol along with any needed credentials can be provided.
This will notify SMAM that the destination is accessed remotely and the specified protocol must be utilized.
This feature will enable users to install SMAM on their local machine and issue commands that interact with a remote service.
An example of installing a plugin called \verb|rtd| on a server accessible via FTP under ``example.com'' with the username ``user'' and password ``pass'':

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\verb|smam install rtd -d ftp://user:pass@example.com:/home/server/|
\end{figure}

Implementation-wise, directory traversal will remain the same because paths are already known, but every IO operation will be performed over the network.
Additional options may be considered, such as utilizing the system's RSA key for SSH transfer, or saving connection credentials in a local configuration file.

Extensions make up a small number of addons, and are specific to the operating system.
This could pose difficulties in case the remote one differs from the user's.
But because extension files are usually bundled together for each system available, this solution is partially addressed.
However, this is not the case on LimeTech.
Special precautions need to be taken when installing extensions from there.
Either SMAM must somehow detect the remote's operating system or the user must provide a flag explicitly to fetch the appropriate build.

\subsection{Recreating server state}

Snapshots may not be a popular feature of package managers, but the local database of installed software could be a great help for capturing a server state.
Moving the local \verb|.smamdata.json| file may become the only thing needed when migrating a game server.
Various settings for the installed addons, pose a separate problem, however, those can be set up by nothing more than a text file.

Migrating the entire servers could also provided by SMAM, when coupled with the remote installation feature.
Such example of a command to move a server in the current directory to a remote one could be completely viable:

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\verb|smam migrate --from . --to ftp://example.com:/home/server/|
\end{figure}

\subsection{Detection of installed addons}

Fresh installation of SourceMod comes with a few officially provided plugins and extensions.
These addons are not too complex in terms of files and provide the core features only.
Suffice to say, they will not be loaded in the local config and thus will not be managed by SMAM\@.
But their simple nature can be a great help for the automatic detection system.
Other addons are unfortunately too varied to implement anything reliable enough.
