\chapter{Introduction}

Proper command line tools play a crucial role in server management.
Their text-only approach through CLI provide operators a straightforward and powerful mean to interact with the machine over a diverse set of media.
One nature of such tools is automating software installation to the point of entering a single command.

SourceMod Addon Manager (SMAM) aims to provide this missing automation to the community built around SourceMod, a server modification for video games that run on Valve's Source engine.
SourceMod is a platform which provides an abstraction layer for its official and community-developed plugins.
A plugin itself is just a binary file that is loaded and run by SourceMod.
However, complications may begin when it is distributed with other files such as configuration, localization or more.
Most of such files must be placed in their individual directories to properly install a SourceMod plugin.
More cases may arise with more advanced plugins, sometimes introducing the need to navigate across the entire server file repository.
Moreover, there exists no standardized mean of distribution, making the administrator rely entirely on instructions provided by the author, wherever the plugin was published.
